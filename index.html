        <p class="card__text">
          When I look back, I'm really not sure what happened to me. You felt special in the crowd. Funnier, more charming,
          simple and lovely. Your whole personality was saying "I'm lovable". Unfortunately, I have only one image of you and me from that night.
          I look like a creep and you look like stunning, as always. But I KNEW even then that I will approach you, and you were overlooking at me.
          I saw it, you know it. I would see your magnificent blue eyes every time I would search for you. Bit by bit, I've made my mind up, took my pride and
          approached you with the famous line: "Wanna grab a drink with me?". The rest is history <3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Funny enough I have a picture of one part of our drink. And funny enough I still have that bottle saved in my room. I will save it forever.

        <p class="card__text">
          That day we were handling our usual business. Monkeying around, or in our case, Gorilling around. Now, maybe you don't
          understand what's the fuss about these images, but I was so scared in this moment that I will not look like a weirdo if I take them.
          I also never took a photo of me and girl like this. Pressed the button and you started laughing. There is the first time for everything I guess...
          In my mind I was screaming from happiness. But I had to play it cool. So I started showing that you smell, how kind of me.

          After that image, you should've known that we won't have many more normal couple photos. But I think you
          don't mind, because it's you and me. We can do whatever we want and however we want. You brought that to my life.
          That funny litte thing called freedom. You can have your own style of taking photos, no cooking book needed when you cook,
          your own way of saying Historitian. Simply put your own path of doing things. At the first glance, to someone who is not you or me,
          it looks just as normal funny photos of a couple. For me these are small reminders that person shouldn't always have
          a strict plan and expectations for others. That life can be something more then just earning, spending and worying about
          where will they spend their whole life already in 20s. You made me wish I had a freedom like you do. Thank you for THEM.
        </p>
        <p>Fun Fact: In one of these images you told me you were dying. Can you guess witch one?</p>

          When I was younger, like when I was 19, I always hated when someone wakes me up. Since I'm 20 it suddenly changed,
          I mean I still mind if someone wakes me up, but not if you do it. When you wake me up, I have the most stupid smile
          on my face and only one thing flies in my head: "Thank you God, for letting this little Son enter my life and
          thank you for giving me the feeling of getting awaken by someone this beautiful."
        </p>
        <p class="card__text">
          And sometimes it also happens that I'm awaken before my star. I sit there and I still have the stupidest smile ever,
           but I just look at you and appreciate your beauty. How something this gorgeous can even exist?
        </p>
        <p>If someone would ask me now what would be mine perfect morning, I would without any doubt say the one
        where I am woken up next to you. I love you more than human mind can comprehend.</p>
